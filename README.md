## Introduction
If you already have your Docker environment set up, how about deploying your app with single push-the-button? That’s what we want to achieve with Docklio — to make system admin’s life easier. Docklio allows users to control their Docker containers by sending text messages and Docklio will send back a message to confirm the container status.

## How to Use
The project is a prove of concept to demo how users can use SMS message to control Docker container. To see the app in action, you need a Twilio developer account and connect it to the web server or local machine. Once that is done, you can text `docker start` to start the container and `docker stop` to stop the same container.

The sample Dockerfile and application is based off the work of:
